# w - Node version management for Windows

Node.js version management: inspired by [n](https://github.com/tj/n).

## Supported Platforms

`w` is supported on Windows only.
It is written in Node.js, but does not require Node.js to work.

Distributed as a pre-built executable.

## Status

It is currently under development, but we plan to implement all the features of `n` in the future.
